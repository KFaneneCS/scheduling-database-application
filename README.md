# Java Database Application: Scheduling

This project was developed as part of a university course to create a GUI-based scheduling desktop application for a hypothetical global consulting organization. The application retrieves data from a MySQL database. The purpose of this application is to provide the user a seamless way to interact with the company's database by adding, updating, and removing customers and appointments. All user login activity is logged.  The user is able to view both customer and appointment tables from the database, with dates and times displayed in user's local time.
